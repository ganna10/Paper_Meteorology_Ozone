In this study, we determined the effects of temperature on ozone production using a box model over a range of temperatures and \ce{NO_x} conditions using a temperature-independent and temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions.
These simulations were repeated using reduced chemical mechanism schemes (CRIv2, MOZART-4, CB05 and RADM2) typically used in 3D models and compared to the near-explicit MCMv3.2 chemical mechanism.
Each chemical mechanism produced a non-linear relationship of ozone with temperature and \ce{NO_x} with the most ozone produced at high temperatures and high emissions of \ce{NO_x}.
Conversely, lower \ce{NO_x} levels led to a minimal increase of ozone with temperature.
Thus air quality in a future with the higher temperatures predicted from climate change would benefit from dramatically reducing \ce{NO_x} emissions.

Faster chemistry at higher temperatures was responsible for a greater absolute increase in ozone than increased isoprene emissions.
Faster thermal decomposition of peroxy nitrates had the largest contribution to ozone production with chemical mechanism and each \ce{NO_x} regime at higher temperatures.
The contribution of peroxy nitrates is larger in MCMv3.2 due to the inclusion of methylperoxy nitrate (\ce{CH3O2NO2}) chemistry that is not included in any other chemical mechanism used in this study.
Including methylperoxy nitrate chemistry in reduced chemical mechanisms would minimise the differences in the production of ozone from reduced chemical mechanisms to the MCMv3.2 at higher temperatures.

The rate of change of ozone with temperature using observational data (ERA-Interim) over Europe was twice as high as that using the box model.
The main reason for the lack of sensitivity is that the box model does not represent stagnant atmospheric conditions that are represented by observational values and simulated by 3D models that include meteorology, such as WRF-Chem.
Future work looking at the influence of temperature on ozone should include stagnant conditions to represent more realistic atmospheric conditions.
Any modelling work addressing this should also consider a range of \ce{NO_x} conditions as this influences the amount of ozone produced.
