In this study, we determined the effects of temperature on ozone production using a box model over a range of temperatures and \ce{NO_x} conditions with a temperature-independent and temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions.
These simulations were repeated using reduced chemical mechanism schemes (CRIv2, MOZART-4, CB05 and RADM2) typically used in 3D models and compared to the near-explicit MCMv3.2 chemical mechanism.

Each chemical mechanism produced a non-linear relationship of ozone with temperature and \ce{NO_x} with the most ozone produced at high temperatures and moderate emissions of \ce{NO_x}.
Conversely, lower \ce{NO_x} levels led to a minimal increase of ozone with temperature.
Thus air quality in a future with higher temperatures would benefit from reductions in \ce{NO_x} emissions.

Faster reaction rates at higher temperatures were responsible for a greater absolute increase in ozone than increased isoprene emissions.
In our simulations, ozone production was controlled by the increased rate of VOC oxidation with temperature.
The net influence of peroxy nitrates increased the net production of \ce{O_x} per molecule of emitted VOC oxidised with temperature.

The rate of increase of ozone with temperature using observational data over Europe was twice as high as the rate of increase of ozone with temperature when using the box model.
This was consistent with our box model setup not representing stagnant atmospheric conditions that are inherently included in observational data and models including meteorology, such as WRF-Chem.
In model simulations without mixing the rate of increase of ozone with temperature was faster than the simulations including mixing.
The simulations without mixing and a maximal ozone production chemical regime led to very similar rates of increase of ozone with temperature to the observational and WRF-Chem data.
Furthermore, the ozone-temperature relationship was more sensitive to mixing than the choice of chemical mechanism.
