%\section{Vertical Mixing with Diurnal Boundary Layer Height} 
%The MECCA box model used in \citet{Coates:2015} included a constant boundary layer height of $1$~km and no interactions (vertical mixing) with the free troposphere.
%In reality, the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height varies diurnally and affects chemistry by diluting emissions after sunrise when the PBL rises. 
%
%The evolution of the PBL leads to vertical mixing of the near surface air with the free tropospheric air mass. 
%When the PBL collapses in the evening, pollutants are trapped in the PBL.  
%The mixing layer height was measured as part of the BAERLIN campaign \citep{Bonn:2016} over Berlin, Germany. 
%The profile of mean mixing layer height during the campaign period (June -- August 2014) was used in the box model to represent the diurnal cycle of the mixing layer height.
%We implemented the vertical mixing scheme into the boxmodel following the approach of \citet{Lourens:2016}.
%
%The mixing ratios of \ce{O3}, CO and \ce{CH4} in the free troposphere were respectively set to $50$~ppbv, $116$~ppbv and $1.8$~ppmv. 
%These conditions were taken from the MATCH-MPIC chemical weather forecast model on the 21st March (the start date of the simulations). 
%The model results (\url{http://cwf.iass-potsdam.de/}) at the 700 hPa height were chosen and the daily average was used as input into the boxmodel.

\section{Allocation of Benelux AVOC emissions to Mechanism Species}
Anthropogenic NMVOC emissions over Benelux specified by the TNO\_MACCIII emission inventory \citep{Kuenen:2014} were translated to MCM~v3.2 emissions (Table~\ref{t:Benelux_MCM_emissions}).
The MCM~v3.2 emissions for each initial species were translated to emissions of mechanism species into CRI~v2, MOZART-4 and RADM2 chemical mechanisms by weighting with the carbon numbers (Tables~\ref{t:CRI_NMVOC_emissions} -- \ref{t:RADM2_NMVOC_emissions}).
The allocation of MCM~v3.2 emissions into CB05 species followed the recommendations of \citet{Yarwood:2005} (Table~\ref{t:CB05_NMVOC_emissions}).

\section{Ozone Production and Consumption Budgets}
\vspace{-2mm}
Section~3.2 of the research article analysed the \ce{O_x} production and consumption budgets normalised by the total loss rate of the emitted VOCs. 
The absolute \ce{O_x} production and consumption budgets are included to support the conclusion that the increased OH-reactivity of the emitted VOCs caused the increase of ozone with temperature in our study.
As in Fig.~4 of the research article the production and consumption of \ce{O_x} are allocated to the net contributions of major categories: `ARO2', `RO2' and `HO2' represent the reaction of acyl peroxy radicals, alkyl peroxy radicals and \ce{HO2} with NO.
`Inorganic' represents the net contribution of inorganic reactions, `RO2NO2' the net contribution of peroxy nitrates and any other reactions were allocated to the `Other Organic' category.
Figure~\ref{f:abs_Ox} represents the absolute production and consumption budgets of \ce{O_x} for each chemical mechanism, each \ce{NO_x}-regime and using a temperature-independent and temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions.

The absolute production and consumption budgets of \ce{O_x} in the box model simulations without mixing, described in Section~3.3 of the research article, are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{f:abs_Ox_no_mix}.
Similar to Fig.~\ref{f:abs_Ox}, the increase in \ce{O_x} with temperature is due to the increased OH-reactivity of emitted VOCs.
The increased \ce{O_x} with temperature led to the faster rate of increase in ozone with temperature than the original box model setup that included mixing, this is presented in Sect.~3.3 of the research article.

All other reactions are allocated to the 'Other Organic' category.}
