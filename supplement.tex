%The total MCM~v3.2 emissions for each initial species in Tables \ref{t:Belgium_MCM_emissions}, \ref{t:Netherlands_MCM_emissions} and \ref{t:Luxembourg_MCM_emissions} were translated to emissions of MOZART-4 species by weighting with the carbon numbers. The final emissions of the MOZART-4 species representing each MCM~v3.2 species are presented in Table \ref{t:MOZART_NMVOC_emissions} for each country in the Benelux region.

\subsection{Vertical Mixing with Diurnal Boundary Layer Height} \label{ss:vertical_mixing}
%most likely include in supplement
\begin{itemize}
    \item The MECCA box model used in \citet{Coates:2015} included a constant boundary layer height of $1$~km and no interactions (vertical mixing) with the free troposphere.
    \item The planetary boundary layer (PBL) height varies diurnally and affects chemistry by diluting emissions after sunrise when the PBL rises. The expansion of the PBL into the free troposphere introduces vertical mixing with those chemical species present in the free troposphere. When the PBL collapses in the evening, pollutants are trapped in the PBL.
    \item The mixing layer height was measured as part of the BAERLIN campaign \todo{Reference Boris' paper} over the city of Berlin, Germany. The profile of mean mixing layer height during the campaign period (June -- August 2014) was used in the model to represent the diurnal cycle of the mixing layer height.
    \item The concentrations of the chemical species within the PBL are diluted due to the larger mixing volume when the PBL height increases at the beginning of the day, also the increasing PBL height mixes the chemical species from the free troposphere with the chemical species within the PBL i.e. vertical mixing. The PBL height collapses during night leaving the stable nocturnal boundary layer, trapping the chemical species into a smaller volume thus increasing the concentrations of the chemical species.
    \item This vertical mixing scheme was implemented into the boxmodel using the same approach of \citet{Lourens:2012}.
    \item The mixing ratios of O3, CO and CH4 in the free troposphere were respectively set to $50$ ppbv, $116$ ppbv and $1.8$ ppmv. These conditions were taken from the MATCH-MPIC chemical weather forecast model on the 21st March (the start date of the simulations). The model results (\url{http://cwf.iass-potsdam.de/}) at the 700 hPa height were chosen and the daily average was used as input into the boxmodel. \todo{check reference}
