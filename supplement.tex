\section{Allocation of Benelux AVOC emissions to Mechanism Species}
Anthropogenic NMVOC emissions over Benelux specified by the TNO\_MACCIII emission inventory \citep{Kuenen:2014} were translated to MCM~v3.2 emissions (Table~\ref{t:Benelux_MCM_emissions}).
The MCM~v3.2 emissions for each initial species were translated to emissions of mechanism species into CRI~v2, MOZART-4 and RADM2 chemical mechanisms by weighting with the carbon numbers (Tables~\ref{t:CRI_NMVOC_emissions} -- \ref{t:RADM2_NMVOC_emissions}).
The allocation of MCM~v3.2 emissions into CB05 species followed the recommendations of \citet{Yarwood:2005} (Table~\ref{t:CB05_NMVOC_emissions}).

\section{Ox Production and Consumption Budgets}
\vspace{-2mm}
Further box model simulations of stagnant conditions were performed as outlined in Section~3.3 of the research article and an analysis similar to that Section~3.2 of the research article looked at the production and consumption budgets of \ce{O_x} was performed.
As in Fig.~4 of the research article the production and consumption of \ce{O_x} are allocated to the net contributions of major categories: `ARO2', `RO2' and `HO2' represent the reaction of acyl peroxy radicals, alkyl peroxy radicals and \ce{HO2} with NO.
`Inorganic' represents the net contribution of inorganic reactions, `RO2NO2' the net contribution of peroxy nitrates and any other reactions were allocated to the `Other Organic' category.
The absolute \ce{O_x} production and consumption budgets for these addition simulations are depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:abs_Ox} while the \ce{O_x} budgets normalised by the total chemical loss rate of emitted VOC are displayed in Fig.~\ref{f:norm_Ox}.
These \ce{O_x} budgets are displayed for each chemical mechanism, \ce{NO_x} condition and source of isoprene emissions (temperature independent and temperature dependent) in Figs.~\ref{f:abs_Ox} and \ref{f:norm_Ox}.
This analysis support the conclusion that the increased OH-reactivity of the emitted VOCs caused the increase of ozone with temperature in our study.

All other reactions are allocated to the 'Other Organic' category.}
