	abstract = "Ground-level ozone is a secondary pollutant produced photochemically from reactions of NOx with peroxy radicals produced during VOC degradation. Chemical transport models use simplified representations of this complex gas-phase chemistry to predict O3 levels and inform emission control strategies. Accurate representation of O3 production chemistry is vital for effective predictions. In this study, VOC degradation chemistry in simplified mechanisms is compared to that in the near-explicit MCM mechanism using a boxmodel and by 'tagging' all organic degradation products over multi-day runs, thus calculating the Tagged Ozone Production Potential (TOPP) for a selection of VOC representative of urban airmasses. Simplified mechanisms that aggregate VOC degradation products instead of aggregating emitted VOC produce comparable amounts of O3 from VOC degradation to the MCM. First day TOPP values are similar across mechanisms for most VOC, with larger discrepancies arising over the course of the model run. Aromatic and unsaturated aliphatic VOC have largest inter-mechanisms differences on the first day, while alkanes show largest differences on the second day. Simplified mechanisms break down VOC into smaller sized degradation products on the first day faster than the MCM impacting the total amount of O3 produced on subsequent days due to secondary chemistry.",

    abstract = "The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1 (MEGAN2.1) is a modeling framework for estimating fluxes of biogenic compounds between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere using simple mechanistic algorithms to account for the major known processes controlling biogenic emissions. It is available as an offline code and has also been coupled into land surface and atmospheric chemistry models. MEGAN2.1 is an update from the previous versions including MEGAN2.0, which was described for isoprene emissions by Guenther et al. (2006) and MEGAN2.02, which was described for monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions by Sakulyanontvittaya et al. (2008). Isoprene comprises about half of the total global biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emission of 1 Pg (1000 Tg or 1015 g) estimated using MEGAN2.1. Methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, $\alpha$-pinene, $\beta$-pinene, t-$\beta$-ocimene, limonene, ethene, and propene together contribute another 30\% of the MEGAN2.1 estimated emission. An additional 20 compounds (mostly terpenoids) are associated with the MEGAN2.1 estimates of another 17\% of the total emission with the remaining 3\% distributed among $\gt$100 compounds. Emissions of 41 monoterpenes and 32 sesquiterpenes together comprise about 15\% and 3\%, respectively, of the estimated total global BVOC emission. Tropical trees cover about 18\% of the global land surface and are estimated to be responsible for 80\% of terpenoid emissions and 50\% of other VOC emissions. Other trees cover about the same area but are estimated to contribute only about 10\% of total emissions. The magnitude of the emissions estimated with MEGAN2.1 are within the range of estimates reported using other approaches and much of the differences between reported values can be attributed to land cover and meteorological driving variables. The offline version of MEGAN2.1 source code and driving variables is available from http://bai.acd.ucar.edu/MEGAN/ and the version integrated into the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) can be downloaded from http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/.",

    abstract = "Emissions to air are reported by countries to EMEP. The emissions data are used for country compliance checking with EU emission ceilings and associated emission reductions. The emissions data are also necessary as input for air quality modelling. The quality of these 'official' emissions varies across Europe. As alternative to these official emissions, a spatially explicit high-resolution emission inventory (7 × 7 km) for UNECE-Europe for all years between 2003 and 2009 for the main air pollutants was made. The primary goal was to supply air quality modellers with the input they need. The inventory was constructed by using the reported emission national totals by sector where the quality is sufficient. The reported data were analysed by sector in detail, and completed with alternative emission estimates as needed. This resulted in a complete emission inventory for all countries. For particulate matter, for each source emissions have been split in coarse and fine particulate matter, and further disaggregated to EC, OC, SO4, Na and other minerals using fractions based on the literature. Doing this at the most detailed sectoral level in the database implies that a consistent set was obtained across Europe. This allows better comparisons with observational data which can, through feedback, help to further identify uncertain sources and/or support emission inventory improvements for this highly uncertain pollutant. The resulting emission data set was spatially distributed consistently across all countries by using proxy parameters. Point sources were spatially distributed using the specific location of the point source. The spatial distribution for the point sources was made year-specific. The TNO-MACC_II is an update of the TNO-MACC emission data set. Major updates included the time extension towards 2009, use of the latest available reported data (including updates and corrections made until early 2012) and updates in distribution maps.",

	abstract = "The Meteorological Synthesizing Centre-West (MSC-W) of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) has been performing model calculations in support of the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) for more than 30 years. The EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model is still one of the key tools within European air pollution policy assessments. Traditionally, the model has covered all of Europe with a resolution of about 50 km × 50 km, and extending vertically from ground level to the tropopause (100 hPa). The model has changed extensively over the last ten years, however, with flexible processing of chemical schemes, meteorological inputs, and with nesting capability: the code is now applied on scales ranging from local (ca. 5 km grid size) to global (with 1 degree resolution). The model is used to simulate photo-oxidants and both inorganic and organic aerosols. In 2008 the EMEP model was released for the first time as public domain code, along with all required input data for model runs for one year. The second release of the EMEP MSC-W model became available in mid 2011, and a new release is targeted for summer 2012. This publication is intended to document this third release of the EMEP MSC-W model. The model formulations are given, along with details of input data-sets which are used, and a brief background on some of the choices made in the formulation is presented. The model code itself is available at www.emep.int, along with the data required to run for a full year over Europe.",

    abstract = "This paper highlights the development of the emission inventories and emission processing for Europe (EU) and North America (NA) in the second phase of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII) project. The main purpose of the second phase of the AQMEII project is to understand the importance of coupled meteorological-chemical models in our understanding of the feedback of chemistry on the meteorology. A second purpose of the second phase of the AQMEII project is to explore the differences between EU and NA in a dynamic evaluation of two modeling years (2006 and 2010). The first phase of AQMEII also considered the modeling year 2006. Comparing the two AQMEII phases, for the EU domain, there were substantial decreases in CO (−19\%), NH3 (−11\%), and SO2 (−12\%) emissions between the phase 2 and phase 1 emissions used for 2006. For the NA domain, there were decreases in CO (−10\%), non-methane hydrocarbons (−5\%), PM2.5 (−8\%), PM10 (−18\%), SO2 (−12\%), with an increase of 4\% in NOx. For the 2010 modeling year, 2009 emissions were used as a proxy for 2010 emissions in the EU domain. Between 2006 and 2009, considerable emission reductions were achieved for 17 EU countries, Norway and Switzerland as well as EU-Non-Member States, for all emitted species aside from NH3, which remained almost stable. Non-EU countries showed little change in emissions levels, though this may be a result of poor data quality. Shipping emissions decreased for PM and SO2 due to Sulfur Emission Control Areas on the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, while increasing for other species. Overall for the EU domain between 2006 and 2009, estimated NOx emissions decreased by 10\%, SO2 by 18\%, CO by 12\%, PM2.5 by 5\%, PM10 by 6\%, NMVOC by 11\%, and NH3 by 1\%. Between the 2006 and 2010 modeling years, estimated US NOx emissions decreased by 17\%, SO2 by 29\%, CO by 21\%, PM2.5 by 12\%, PM10 by 7\%, NMHC by 4\% and NH3 by 2\% while Canadian and Mexican emissions were assumed to remain constant. These changes in US emissions, however, only reflect changes in sectors for which we had year-specific information. In terms of natural emissions, climatic differences between 2006 and 2010 caused the European emissions of isoprene to peak earlier in the year 2006 than in 2010, and overall achieved higher levels in 2010. Biogenic emissions in North America increased in the east and decreased in the west between 2006 and 2010, due to regional temperature differences between the years from natural variation in solar radiation reaching the ground.
