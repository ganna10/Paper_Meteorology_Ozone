	abstract = "Ground-level ozone is a secondary pollutant produced photochemically from reactions of NOx with peroxy radicals produced during VOC degradation. Chemical transport models use simplified representations of this complex gas-phase chemistry to predict O3 levels and inform emission control strategies. Accurate representation of O3 production chemistry is vital for effective predictions. In this study, VOC degradation chemistry in simplified mechanisms is compared to that in the near-explicit MCM mechanism using a boxmodel and by 'tagging' all organic degradation products over multi-day runs, thus calculating the Tagged Ozone Production Potential (TOPP) for a selection of VOC representative of urban airmasses. Simplified mechanisms that aggregate VOC degradation products instead of aggregating emitted VOC produce comparable amounts of O3 from VOC degradation to the MCM. First day TOPP values are similar across mechanisms for most VOC, with larger discrepancies arising over the course of the model run. Aromatic and unsaturated aliphatic VOC have largest inter-mechanisms differences on the first day, while alkanes show largest differences on the second day. Simplified mechanisms break down VOC into smaller sized degradation products on the first day faster than the MCM impacting the total amount of O3 produced on subsequent days due to secondary chemistry.",

It is available as an offline code and has also been coupled into land surface and atmospheric chemistry models. MEGAN2.1 is an update from the previous versions including MEGAN2.0, which was described for isoprene emissions by Guenther et al. (2006) and MEGAN2.02, which was described for monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions by Sakulyanontvittaya et al. (2008). Isoprene comprises about half of the total global biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emission of 1 Pg (1000 Tg or 1015 g) estimated using MEGAN2.1. Methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, $\alpha$-pinene, $\beta$-pinene, t-$\beta$-ocimene, limonene, ethene, and propene together contribute another 30\% of the MEGAN2.1 estimated emission. An additional 20 compounds (mostly terpenoids) are associated with the MEGAN2.1 estimates of another 17\% of the total emission with the remaining 3\% distributed among $\gt$100 compounds. Emissions of 41 monoterpenes and 32 sesquiterpenes together comprise about 15\% and 3\%, respectively, of the estimated total global BVOC emission. Tropical trees cover about 18\% of the global land surface and are estimated to be responsible for 80\% of terpenoid emissions and 50\% of other VOC emissions. Other trees cover about the same area but are estimated to contribute only about 10\% of total emissions. The magnitude of the emissions estimated with MEGAN2.1 are within the range of estimates reported using other approaches and much of the differences between reported values can be attributed to land cover and meteorological driving variables. The offline version of MEGAN2.1 source code and driving variables is available from http://bai.acd.ucar.edu/MEGAN/ and the version integrated into the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) can be downloaded from http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/.",

    abstract = "Emissions to air are reported by countries to EMEP. The emissions data are used for country compliance checking with EU emission ceilings and associated emission reductions. The emissions data are also necessary as input for air quality modelling. The quality of these 'official' emissions varies across Europe. As alternative to these official emissions, a spatially explicit high-resolution emission inventory (7 × 7 km) for UNECE-Europe for all years between 2003 and 2009 for the main air pollutants was made. The primary goal was to supply air quality modellers with the input they need. The inventory was constructed by using the reported emission national totals by sector where the quality is sufficient. The reported data were analysed by sector in detail, and completed with alternative emission estimates as needed. This resulted in a complete emission inventory for all countries. For particulate matter, for each source emissions have been split in coarse and fine particulate matter, and further disaggregated to EC, OC, SO4, Na and other minerals using fractions based on the literature. Doing this at the most detailed sectoral level in the database implies that a consistent set was obtained across Europe. This allows better comparisons with observational data which can, through feedback, help to further identify uncertain sources and/or support emission inventory improvements for this highly uncertain pollutant. The resulting emission data set was spatially distributed consistently across all countries by using proxy parameters. Point sources were spatially distributed using the specific location of the point source. The spatial distribution for the point sources was made year-specific. The TNO-MACC_II is an update of the TNO-MACC emission data set. Major updates included the time extension towards 2009, use of the latest available reported data (including updates and corrections made until early 2012) and updates in distribution maps.",

The EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model is still one of the key tools within European air pollution policy assessments. Traditionally, the model has covered all of Europe with a resolution of about 50 km × 50 km, and extending vertically from ground level to the tropopause (100 hPa). The model has changed extensively over the last ten years, however, with flexible processing of chemical schemes, meteorological inputs, and with nesting capability: the code is now applied on scales ranging from local (ca. 5 km grid size) to global (with 1 degree resolution). The model is used to simulate photo-oxidants and both inorganic and organic aerosols. In 2008 the EMEP model was released for the first time as public domain code, along with all required input data for model runs for one year. The second release of the EMEP MSC-W model became available in mid 2011, and a new release is targeted for summer 2012. This publication is intended to document this third release of the EMEP MSC-W model. The model formulations are given, along with details of input data-sets which are used, and a brief background on some of the choices made in the formulation is presented.

The main purpose of the second phase of the AQMEII project is to understand the importance of coupled meteorological-chemical models in our understanding of the feedback of chemistry on the meteorology. A second purpose of the second phase of the AQMEII project is to explore the differences between EU and NA in a dynamic evaluation of two modeling years (2006 and 2010). The first phase of AQMEII also considered the modeling year 2006. Comparing the two AQMEII phases, for the EU domain, there were substantial decreases in CO (−19\%), NH3 (−11\%), and SO2 (−12\%) emissions between the phase 2 and phase 1 emissions used for 2006. For the NA domain, there were decreases in CO (−10\%), non-methane hydrocarbons (−5\%), PM2.5 (−8\%), PM10 (−18\%), SO2 (−12\%), with an increase of 4\% in NOx. For the 2010 modeling year, 2009 emissions were used as a proxy for 2010 emissions in the EU domain. Between 2006 and 2009, considerable emission reductions were achieved for 17 EU countries, Norway and Switzerland as well as EU-Non-Member States, for all emitted species aside from NH3, which remained almost stable. Non-EU countries showed little change in emissions levels, though this may be a result of poor data quality. Shipping emissions decreased for PM and SO2 due to Sulfur Emission Control Areas on the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, while increasing for other species. Overall for the EU domain between 2006 and 2009, estimated NOx emissions decreased by 10\%, SO2 by 18\%, CO by 12\%, PM2.5 by 5\%, PM10 by 6\%, NMVOC by 11\%, and NH3 by 1\%. Between the 2006 and 2010 modeling years, estimated US NOx emissions decreased by 17\%, SO2 by 29\%, CO by 21\%, PM2.5 by 12\%, PM10 by 7\%, NMHC by 4\% and NH3 by 2\% while Canadian and Mexican emissions were assumed to remain constant. These changes in US emissions, however, only reflect changes in sectors for which we had year-specific information. In terms of natural emissions, climatic differences between 2006 and 2010 caused the European emissions of isoprene to peak earlier in the year 2006 than in 2010, and overall achieved higher levels in 2010. Biogenic emissions in North America increased in the east and decreased in the west between 2006 and 2010, due to regional temperature differences between the years from natural variation in solar radiation reaching the ground.

To improve our understanding of trends in the number of ozone violations in the SJV, we analyze observed relationships between organic reactivity, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and daily maximum temperature in the southern SJV using measurements made as part of California at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change in 2010 (CalNex-SJV). We find the daytime speciated organic reactivity with respect to OH during CalNex-SJV has a temperature-independent portion with molecules typically associated with motor vehicles being the major component. At high temperatures, characteristic of days with high ozone, the largest portion of the total organic reactivity increases exponentially with temperature and is dominated by small, oxygenated organics and molecules that are unidentified. We use this simple temperature classification to consider changes in organic emissions over the last and next decade. With the CalNex-SJV observations as constraints, we examine the sensitivity of ozone production (PO3) to future NOx and organic reactivity controls. We find that PO3 is NOx-limited at all temperatures on weekends and on weekdays when daily maximum temperatures are greater than 29 C. As a consequence, NOx reductions are the most effective control option for reducing the frequency of future ozone violations in the southern SJV.",

The Common Representative Intermediates mechanism version 2 (CRI v2) has been built up on a compound-by-compound basis, with the performance of its chemistry optimised for each compound in turn by comparison with that of MCM v3.1, using a series of five-day box model simulations. The resultant mechanism contains 1183 reactions of 434 chemical species, i.e., ca. 10\% of the number of reactions and species to degrade the same set of VOCs in MCM v3.1. Similarly to CRI v1 (Jenkin et al., 2002a), a key assumption in the CRI v2 construction methodology is that the potential for ozone formation from a given volatile organic compound (VOC) is related to the number of reactive (i.e., CC and CH) bonds it contains. This index allows a series of generic intermediates to be defined, with each being used as a “common representative” for a large set of species possessing the same index, as formed in detailed mechanisms such as the MCM. The performance of CRI v2 is shown to compare well with that of MCM v3.1 for a wide range of ambient conditions, which consider variations in VOC/NOx emissions ratio over ranges of 32 and 400 for anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs, respectively, in box model simulations; and in simulations of the TORCH 2003 campaign in the southern UK using a photochemical trajectory model, which considers notable ranges in the relative and absolute emissions of NOx and VOCs, and in the relative contributions of anthropogenic and biogenic species to the VOC total. CRI v2 is a reduced mechanism of intermediate complexity, which is traceable to MCM v3.1, and which provides the basis for further systematic reduction. Two companion papers consider further reduction of CRI v2 through emissions lumping and development and assessment of an associated SOA module. "

The second generation Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM2) gas phase chemical mechanism, like its predecessor RADM1, is highly nonlinear, since predicted ozone, sulfate, nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide concentrations are complicated functions of NOx and nonmethane hydrocarbon concentrations. The RADM2 chemical mechanism is an upgrade of RADM1 in that (1) three classes of higher alkanes are used instead of one, (2) a more detailed treatment of aromatic chemistry is used, (3) the two higher alkene classes now represent internal and terminal alkenes, (4) ketones and dicarbonyl species are treated as classes distinct from aldehydes, (5) isoprene is now included as an explicit species, and (6) there is a more detailed treatment of peroxy radical-peroxy radical reactions. As a result of these improvements the RADM2 mechanism simulates the concentrations of peroxyacetyl nitrate, HNO3, and H2O2 under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Comparisons of RADM2 mechanism with the RADM1 mechanism predictions and selected environmental chamber experimental results indicate that for typical atmospheric conditions, both mechanisms reliably predict O3, sulfate and nitric acid concentrations. The RADM2 mechanism gives lower and presumably more realistic predictions of H2O2 because of its more detailed treatment of peroxy radical-peroxy radical reactions.},

    abstract = " Reactive gases and aerosols are produced by terrestrial ecosystems, processed within plant canopies, and can then be emitted into the above-canopy atmosphere. Estimates of the above-canopy fluxes are needed for quantitative earth system studies and assessments of past, present and future air quality and climate. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) is described and used to quantify net terrestrial biosphere emission of isoprene into the atmosphere. MEGAN is designed for both global and regional emission modeling and has global coverage with 1 km2 spatial resolution. Field and laboratory investigations of the processes controlling isoprene emission are described and data available for model development and evaluation are summarized. The factors controlling isoprene emissions include biological, physical and chemical driving variables. MEGAN driving variables are derived from models and satellite and ground observations. Tropical broadleaf trees contribute almost half of the estimated global annual isoprene emission due to their relatively high emission factors and because they are often exposed to conditions that are conducive for isoprene emission. The remaining flux is primarily from shrubs which have a widespread distribution. The annual global isoprene emission estimated with MEGAN ranges from about 500 to 750 Tg isoprene (440 to 660 Tg carbon) depending on the driving variables which include temperature, solar radiation, Leaf Area Index, and plant functional type. The global annual isoprene emission estimated using the standard driving variables is 600 Tg isoprene. Differences in driving variables result in emission estimates that differ by more than a factor of three for specific times and locations. It is difficult to evaluate isoprene emission estimates using the concentration distributions simulated using chemistry and transport models, due to the substantial uncertainties in other model components, but at least some global models produce reasonable results when using isoprene emission distributions similar to MEGAN estimates. In addition, comparison with isoprene emissions estimated from satellite formaldehyde observations indicates reasonable agreement. The sensitivity of isoprene emissions to earth system changes (e.g., climate and land-use) demonstrates the potential for large future changes in emissions. Using temperature distributions simulated by global climate models for year 2100, MEGAN estimates that isoprene emissions increase by more than a factor of two. This is considerably greater than previous estimates and additional observations are needed to evaluate and improve the methods used to predict future isoprene emissions.",
