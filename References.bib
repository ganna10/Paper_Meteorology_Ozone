	abstract = "Ground-level ozone is a secondary pollutant produced photochemically from reactions of NOx with peroxy radicals produced during VOC degradation. Chemical transport models use simplified representations of this complex gas-phase chemistry to predict O3 levels and inform emission control strategies. Accurate representation of O3 production chemistry is vital for effective predictions. In this study, VOC degradation chemistry in simplified mechanisms is compared to that in the near-explicit MCM mechanism using a boxmodel and by 'tagging' all organic degradation products over multi-day runs, thus calculating the Tagged Ozone Production Potential (TOPP) for a selection of VOC representative of urban airmasses. Simplified mechanisms that aggregate VOC degradation products instead of aggregating emitted VOC produce comparable amounts of O3 from VOC degradation to the MCM. First day TOPP values are similar across mechanisms for most VOC, with larger discrepancies arising over the course of the model run. Aromatic and unsaturated aliphatic VOC have largest inter-mechanisms differences on the first day, while alkanes show largest differences on the second day. Simplified mechanisms break down VOC into smaller sized degradation products on the first day faster than the MCM impacting the total amount of O3 produced on subsequent days due to secondary chemistry.",

It is available as an offline code and has also been coupled into land surface and atmospheric chemistry models. MEGAN2.1 is an update from the previous versions including MEGAN2.0, which was described for isoprene emissions by Guenther et al. (2006) and MEGAN2.02, which was described for monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions by Sakulyanontvittaya et al. (2008). Isoprene comprises about half of the total global biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emission of 1 Pg (1000 Tg or 1015 g) estimated using MEGAN2.1. Methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, $\alpha$-pinene, $\beta$-pinene, t-$\beta$-ocimene, limonene, ethene, and propene together contribute another 30\% of the MEGAN2.1 estimated emission. An additional 20 compounds (mostly terpenoids) are associated with the MEGAN2.1 estimates of another 17\% of the total emission with the remaining 3\% distributed among $\gt$100 compounds. Emissions of 41 monoterpenes and 32 sesquiterpenes together comprise about 15\% and 3\%, respectively, of the estimated total global BVOC emission. Tropical trees cover about 18\% of the global land surface and are estimated to be responsible for 80\% of terpenoid emissions and 50\% of other VOC emissions. Other trees cover about the same area but are estimated to contribute only about 10\% of total emissions. The magnitude of the emissions estimated with MEGAN2.1 are within the range of estimates reported using other approaches and much of the differences between reported values can be attributed to land cover and meteorological driving variables. The offline version of MEGAN2.1 source code and driving variables is available from http://bai.acd.ucar.edu/MEGAN/ and the version integrated into the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) can be downloaded from http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/.",

    abstract = "Emissions to air are reported by countries to EMEP. The emissions data are used for country compliance checking with EU emission ceilings and associated emission reductions. The emissions data are also necessary as input for air quality modelling. The quality of these 'official' emissions varies across Europe. As alternative to these official emissions, a spatially explicit high-resolution emission inventory (7 × 7 km) for UNECE-Europe for all years between 2003 and 2009 for the main air pollutants was made. The primary goal was to supply air quality modellers with the input they need. The inventory was constructed by using the reported emission national totals by sector where the quality is sufficient. The reported data were analysed by sector in detail, and completed with alternative emission estimates as needed. This resulted in a complete emission inventory for all countries. For particulate matter, for each source emissions have been split in coarse and fine particulate matter, and further disaggregated to EC, OC, SO4, Na and other minerals using fractions based on the literature. Doing this at the most detailed sectoral level in the database implies that a consistent set was obtained across Europe. This allows better comparisons with observational data which can, through feedback, help to further identify uncertain sources and/or support emission inventory improvements for this highly uncertain pollutant. The resulting emission data set was spatially distributed consistently across all countries by using proxy parameters. Point sources were spatially distributed using the specific location of the point source. The spatial distribution for the point sources was made year-specific. The TNO-MACC_II is an update of the TNO-MACC emission data set. Major updates included the time extension towards 2009, use of the latest available reported data (including updates and corrections made until early 2012) and updates in distribution maps.",

The EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model is still one of the key tools within European air pollution policy assessments. Traditionally, the model has covered all of Europe with a resolution of about 50 km × 50 km, and extending vertically from ground level to the tropopause (100 hPa). The model has changed extensively over the last ten years, however, with flexible processing of chemical schemes, meteorological inputs, and with nesting capability: the code is now applied on scales ranging from local (ca. 5 km grid size) to global (with 1 degree resolution). The model is used to simulate photo-oxidants and both inorganic and organic aerosols. In 2008 the EMEP model was released for the first time as public domain code, along with all required input data for model runs for one year. The second release of the EMEP MSC-W model became available in mid 2011, and a new release is targeted for summer 2012. This publication is intended to document this third release of the EMEP MSC-W model. The model formulations are given, along with details of input data-sets which are used, and a brief background on some of the choices made in the formulation is presented.

The main purpose of the second phase of the AQMEII project is to understand the importance of coupled meteorological-chemical models in our understanding of the feedback of chemistry on the meteorology. A second purpose of the second phase of the AQMEII project is to explore the differences between EU and NA in a dynamic evaluation of two modeling years (2006 and 2010). The first phase of AQMEII also considered the modeling year 2006. Comparing the two AQMEII phases, for the EU domain, there were substantial decreases in CO (−19\%), NH3 (−11\%), and SO2 (−12\%) emissions between the phase 2 and phase 1 emissions used for 2006. For the NA domain, there were decreases in CO (−10\%), non-methane hydrocarbons (−5\%), PM2.5 (−8\%), PM10 (−18\%), SO2 (−12\%), with an increase of 4\% in NOx. For the 2010 modeling year, 2009 emissions were used as a proxy for 2010 emissions in the EU domain. Between 2006 and 2009, considerable emission reductions were achieved for 17 EU countries, Norway and Switzerland as well as EU-Non-Member States, for all emitted species aside from NH3, which remained almost stable. Non-EU countries showed little change in emissions levels, though this may be a result of poor data quality. Shipping emissions decreased for PM and SO2 due to Sulfur Emission Control Areas on the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, while increasing for other species. Overall for the EU domain between 2006 and 2009, estimated NOx emissions decreased by 10\%, SO2 by 18\%, CO by 12\%, PM2.5 by 5\%, PM10 by 6\%, NMVOC by 11\%, and NH3 by 1\%. Between the 2006 and 2010 modeling years, estimated US NOx emissions decreased by 17\%, SO2 by 29\%, CO by 21\%, PM2.5 by 12\%, PM10 by 7\%, NMHC by 4\% and NH3 by 2\% while Canadian and Mexican emissions were assumed to remain constant. These changes in US emissions, however, only reflect changes in sectors for which we had year-specific information. In terms of natural emissions, climatic differences between 2006 and 2010 caused the European emissions of isoprene to peak earlier in the year 2006 than in 2010, and overall achieved higher levels in 2010. Biogenic emissions in North America increased in the east and decreased in the west between 2006 and 2010, due to regional temperature differences between the years from natural variation in solar radiation reaching the ground.

We find the daytime speciated organic reactivity with respect to OH during CalNex-SJV has a temperature-independent portion with molecules typically associated with motor vehicles being the major component. At high temperatures, characteristic of days with high ozone, the largest portion of the total organic reactivity increases exponentially with temperature and is dominated by small, oxygenated organics and molecules that are unidentified. We use this simple temperature classification to consider changes in organic emissions over the last and next decade. With the CalNex-SJV observations as constraints, we examine the sensitivity of ozone production (PO3) to future NOx and organic reactivity controls. We find that PO3 is NOx-limited at all temperatures on weekends and on weekdays when daily maximum temperatures are greater than 29 C. As a consequence, NOx reductions are the most effective control option for reducing the frequency of future ozone violations in the southern SJV.",

The Common Representative Intermediates mechanism version 2 (CRI v2) has been built up on a compound-by-compound basis, with the performance of its chemistry optimised for each compound in turn by comparison with that of MCM v3.1, using a series of five-day box model simulations. The resultant mechanism contains 1183 reactions of 434 chemical species, i.e., ca. 10\% of the number of reactions and species to degrade the same set of VOCs in MCM v3.1. Similarly to CRI v1 (Jenkin et al., 2002a), a key assumption in the CRI v2 construction methodology is that the potential for ozone formation from a given volatile organic compound (VOC) is related to the number of reactive (i.e., CC and CH) bonds it contains. This index allows a series of generic intermediates to be defined, with each being used as a “common representative” for a large set of species possessing the same index, as formed in detailed mechanisms such as the MCM. The performance of CRI v2 is shown to compare well with that of MCM v3.1 for a wide range of ambient conditions, which consider variations in VOC/NOx emissions ratio over ranges of 32 and 400 for anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs, respectively, in box model simulations; and in simulations of the TORCH 2003 campaign in the southern UK using a photochemical trajectory model, which considers notable ranges in the relative and absolute emissions of NOx and VOCs, and in the relative contributions of anthropogenic and biogenic species to the VOC total. CRI v2 is a reduced mechanism of intermediate complexity, which is traceable to MCM v3.1, and which provides the basis for further systematic reduction. Two companion papers consider further reduction of CRI v2 through emissions lumping and development and assessment of an associated SOA module. "

The second generation Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM2) gas phase chemical mechanism, like its predecessor RADM1, is highly nonlinear, since predicted ozone, sulfate, nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide concentrations are complicated functions of NOx and nonmethane hydrocarbon concentrations. The RADM2 chemical mechanism is an upgrade of RADM1 in that (1) three classes of higher alkanes are used instead of one, (2) a more detailed treatment of aromatic chemistry is used, (3) the two higher alkene classes now represent internal and terminal alkenes, (4) ketones and dicarbonyl species are treated as classes distinct from aldehydes, (5) isoprene is now included as an explicit species, and (6) there is a more detailed treatment of peroxy radical-peroxy radical reactions. As a result of these improvements the RADM2 mechanism simulates the concentrations of peroxyacetyl nitrate, HNO3, and H2O2 under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Comparisons of RADM2 mechanism with the RADM1 mechanism predictions and selected environmental chamber experimental results indicate that for typical atmospheric conditions, both mechanisms reliably predict O3, sulfate and nitric acid concentrations. The RADM2 mechanism gives lower and presumably more realistic predictions of H2O2 because of its more detailed treatment of peroxy radical-peroxy radical reactions.},

    abstract = " Reactive gases and aerosols are produced by terrestrial ecosystems, processed within plant canopies, and can then be emitted into the above-canopy atmosphere. Estimates of the above-canopy fluxes are needed for quantitative earth system studies and assessments of past, present and future air quality and climate. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) is described and used to quantify net terrestrial biosphere emission of isoprene into the atmosphere. MEGAN is designed for both global and regional emission modeling and has global coverage with 1 km2 spatial resolution. Field and laboratory investigations of the processes controlling isoprene emission are described and data available for model development and evaluation are summarized. The factors controlling isoprene emissions include biological, physical and chemical driving variables. MEGAN driving variables are derived from models and satellite and ground observations. Tropical broadleaf trees contribute almost half of the estimated global annual isoprene emission due to their relatively high emission factors and because they are often exposed to conditions that are conducive for isoprene emission. The remaining flux is primarily from shrubs which have a widespread distribution. The annual global isoprene emission estimated with MEGAN ranges from about 500 to 750 Tg isoprene (440 to 660 Tg carbon) depending on the driving variables which include temperature, solar radiation, Leaf Area Index, and plant functional type. The global annual isoprene emission estimated using the standard driving variables is 600 Tg isoprene. Differences in driving variables result in emission estimates that differ by more than a factor of three for specific times and locations. It is difficult to evaluate isoprene emission estimates using the concentration distributions simulated using chemistry and transport models, due to the substantial uncertainties in other model components, but at least some global models produce reasonable results when using isoprene emission distributions similar to MEGAN estimates. In addition, comparison with isoprene emissions estimated from satellite formaldehyde observations indicates reasonable agreement. The sensitivity of isoprene emissions to earth system changes (e.g., climate and land-use) demonstrates the potential for large future changes in emissions. Using temperature distributions simulated by global climate models for year 2100, MEGAN estimates that isoprene emissions increase by more than a factor of two. This is considerably greater than previous estimates and additional observations are needed to evaluate and improve the methods used to predict future isoprene emissions.",

Recent studies have provided estimates of this climate effect through correlations of air quality with meteorological variables, perturbation analyses in chemical transport models (CTMs), and CTM simulations driven by general circulation model (GCM) simulations of 21st-century climate change. We review these different approaches and their results. The future climate is expected to be more stagnant, due to a weaker global circulation and a decreasing frequency of mid-latitude cyclones. The observed correlation between surface ozone and temperature in polluted regions points to a detrimental effect of warming. Coupled GCM–CTM studies find that climate change alone will increase summertime surface ozone in polluted regions by 1–10 ppb over the coming decades, with the largest effects in urban areas and during pollution episodes. This climate penalty means that stronger emission controls will be needed to meet a given air quality standard. Higher water vapor in the future climate is expected to decrease the ozone background, so that pollution and background ozone have opposite sensitivities to climate change. The effect of climate change on particulate matter (PM) is more complicated and uncertain than for ozone. Precipitation frequency and mixing depth are important driving factors but projections for these variables are often unreliable. GCM–CTM studies find that climate change will affect PM concentrations in polluted environments by ±0.1–1 μg m−3 over the coming decades. Wildfires fueled by climate change could become an increasingly important PM source. Major issues that should be addressed in future research include the ability of GCMs to simulate regional air pollution meteorology and its sensitivity to climate change, the response of natural emissions to climate change, and the atmospheric chemistry of isoprene. Research needs to be undertaken on the effect of climate change on mercury, particularly in view of the potential for a large increase in mercury soil emissions driven by increased respiration in boreal ecosystems.

    abstract = {Correlations are presented between model predictions for O3-NOx-hydrocarbon sensitivity and afternoon concentrations of four “indicator species”: NOy, O3/(NOy-NOx), HCHO/NOy, and H2O2/HNO3. The indicator species correlations are based on a series of photochemical simulations with varying rates of anthropogenic and biogenic emissions and meteorology. Hydrocarbon-sensitive chemistry in models is shown to be linked to afternoon NOy > 20 ppb, O3/(NOy - NOx) < 7, HCHO/NOy < 0.28, and H2O2/HNO3 < 0.4. Lower NOy and higher ratios correspond with NOx-sensitive ozone. The correlation between NOx-hydrocarbon sensitivity and indicator species remains, even when model emission rates and hydrocarbon/NOx ratios are changed by a factor of 2. Methods are developed for evaluating the goodness of fit between model NOx-hydrocarbon sensitivity and indicator values. Ozone chemistry is also analyzed in terms of fundamental properties of odd hydrogen, and theoretical criteria for the transition between NOx- and hydrocarbon-sensitive regimes are derived. A theoretical correlation between O3 and H2O2 + NOy - NOx is developed as a way to extend rural O3-NOy correlations into urban locations. Measured indicator values during pollution events in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and rural Virginia are used to illustrate the range of observed values under different environmental conditions.},

	abstract = "The impact of temperature on formation of O3 and odd nitrogen photochemistry is investigated using urban-, regional- and global-scale simulations. Urban and polluted rural environments are explored with a regional simulation derived from a specific episode in the midwestern United States. The simulations predict that O3 increases with temperature in both urban and polluted rural environments. The O3-temperature relation is driven largely by chemistry of peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) which represents an increased sink for both NOx and odd hydrogen at low temperatures. Isoprene emissions, H2O, and solar radiation also contribute to the O3-temperature relation. Possible correlations between temperature and anthropogenic emissions or stagnant meteorology were not included. Observations at urban and rural sites in the United States suggests that O3 increases with temperature at a faster rate than the models predict. Calculations with a one-dimensional global model suggest that increased temperature in the polluted boundary layer does not lead to increased O3 in the free troposphere, because increased export of O3 is balanced by decreased export of odd nitrogen species.",

This article presents a review of insights derived from photochemical models and field measurements. The ozone–precursor relationship can be understood in terms of a fundamental split into a NOx-senstive and VOC-sensitive (or NOx-saturated) chemical regimes. These regimes are associated with the chemistry of odd hydrogen radicals and appear in different forms in studies of urbanized regions, power plant plumes and the remote troposphere. Factors that affect the split into NOx-sensitive and VOC-sensitive chemistry include: VOC/NOx ratios, VOC reactivity, biogenic hydrocarbons, photochemical aging, and rates of meteorological dispersion. Analyses of ozone–NOx–VOC sensitivity from 3D photochemical models show a consistent pattern, but predictions for the impact of reduced NOx and VOC in indivdual locations are often very uncertain. This uncertainty can be identified by comparing predictions from different model scenarios that reflect uncertainties in meteorology, anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. Several observation-based approaches have been proposed that seek to evaluate ozone–NOx–VOC sensitivity directly from ambient measurements (including ambient VOC, reactive nitrogen, and peroxides). Observation-based approaches have also been used to evaluate emission rates, ozone production efficiency, and removal rates of chemically active species. Use of these methods in combination with models can significantly reduce the uncertainty associated with model predictions. "

    abstract = { Climate change is expected to increase global mean temperatures leading to higher tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations in already polluted regions, potentially eroding the benefits of expensive emission controls. The magnitude of the “O3–climate penalty” has generally decreased over the past three decades, which makes future predictions for climate impacts on air quality uncertain. Researchers attribute historical reductions in the O3–climate penalty to reductions in NOx emissions but have so far not extended this theory into a quantitative prediction for future effects. Here, we show that a three-dimensional air quality model can be used to map the behavior of the O3–climate penalty under varying NOx and VOC emissions in both NOx-limited and NOx-saturated conditions in Central and Southern California, respectively. Simulations suggest that the planned emissions control program for O3 precursors will not diminish the O3–climate penalty to zero as some observational studies might imply. The results further demonstrate that in a NOx-limited air basin, NOx control strategies alone are sufficient to both decrease the O3–climate penalty and mitigate O3 pollution, while in a NOx-saturated air basin, a modified emissions control plan that carefully chooses reductions in both NOx and VOC emissions may be necessary to eliminate the O3–climate penalty while simultaneously reducing base case O3 concentrations to desired levels. Additional modeling is needed to determine the behavior of the O3–climate penalty as NOx and VOC emissions evolve in other regions. }

The simulation period consists of July 12–21, 2001, during which an ozone episode occurred over the Southeast. The ozone metrics used include daily maximum 8 h average O3 concentration and number of grid cells exceeding the US EPA ambient air-quality standard. The meteorological factor that had the largest impact on both ozone metrics was temperature, which increased daily maximum 8 h average O3 by 0.34 ppb K−1 on average over the simulation domain. Absolute humidity had a smaller but appreciable effect on daily maximum 8 h average O3 (−0.025 ppb for each percent increase in absolute humidity). While domain-average responses to changes in wind speed, mixing height, cloud liquid water content, and optical depth were rather small, these factors did have appreciable local effects in many areas. Temperature also had the largest effect on air-quality standard exceedances; a 2.5 K temperature increase led to a 30\% increase in the area exceeding the EPA standard. Wind speed and mixing height also had appreciable effects on ozone air-quality standard exceedances. "

A new condensed reaction mechanism is included for biogenic compounds: isoprene, alpha-pinene, and d-limonene. The branching ratios for alkane decay were reevaluated, and in the revised mechanism the aldehyde to ketone ratios were significantly reduced. The relatively large amounts of nitrates resulting from the reactions of unbranched alkenes with NO3 are now included, and the production of HO from the ozonolysis of alkenes has a much greater yield. The aromatic chemistry has been revised through the use of new laboratory data. The yield of cresol production from aromatics was reduced, while the reactions of HO, NO3, and O3 with unsaturated dicarbonyl species and unsaturated peroxynitrate are now included in the RACM mechanism. The peroxyacetyl nitrate chemistry and the organic peroxy radical-peroxy radical reactions were revised, and organic peroxy radical +NO3 reactions were added.},

In this study we examine predictions from the Carbon Bond 4 mechanism, the Regional Acid Deposition Model 2 mechanism, and an explicit mechanism used in global modeling. Several reactions are identified which influence the concentrations of important NOy species. The most important reaction under rural conditions is the oxidation of isoprene, which influences the production of PAN and organic nitrate. Differences among mechanisms cause large differences in the NOy concentrations, which propagate throughout the entire mechanism, affecting the chemistry of all species. The largest differences in NOy species among the mechanisms occur in the rural simulations, while predictions are the most similar under urban conditions, for which photochemical mechanisms have been studied and evaluated. The differences in NOy speciation cause uncertainties in the use of these mechanisms for predicting oxidant chemistry over long distances and multi-day episodes under non-urban conditions. Predictions from all mechanisms should be regarded with caution under rural conditions. "

The model's global distribution of PAN is in reasonable agreement with most available observations. In the atmospheric boundary layer, PAN is concentrated over the continental sites of NOx emissions, primarily the midlatitudes in the northern hemisphere and the subtropics in the southern hemisphere. PAN is distributed relatively zonally throughout the free troposphere of the northern hemisphere, with the maximum levels found in the coldest regions, while in the southern hemisphere the maximum PAN levels are found in an equator to 30°S belt stretching from South America to Australia. Overall, the simulated three-dimensional fields of seasonal PAN are a result of the interaction of the type of transport meteorology (convective or synoptic scale storms) occurring in the PAN formation regions and PAN's temperature-dependent lifetime. We find the impact of PAN chemistry on NOx to be rather subtle. The magnitude and the seasonal cycle of the global tropospheric integral of NOx, which has its maximum in January and the formation of HNO3 as its dominant loss path, are barely affected by the inclusion of PAN chemistry, however PAN, as a result of its temperature sensitivity and transport, regionally provides an efficient mechanism for redistributing NOx far from its source areas. With the inclusion of PAN chemistry, monthly mean NOx concentrations increase by up to a factor of 5 in the remote lower troposphere and show a spring maximum over areas of the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. In contrast, PAN has only a minor impact in the upper half of the troposphere (±10\%). Examining local time series of NOx and PAN, the monthly mean mixing ratios in remote regions are shown to be composed of numerous short-term (1–2 days) large magnitude events. These episodes are large enough to potentially result in ozone production even when the monthly mean NOx values are in the ozone destruction range. While both the direct transport of NOx and its indirect transport as PAN contribute to the elevated NOx episodes over the remote extratropical oceans, events over the remote subtropical oceans are dominated by midtropospheric PAN that sinks anticyclonically equatorward and decomposes to NOx in the warmer air.},

In this review, laboratory studies of this peroxy radical chemistry are detailed, as they pertain to the chemistry of the atmosphere. First, a brief discussion of methods used to detect the peroxy radicals in the laboratory is presented. Then, the basic reaction pathways - involving RO2 unimolecular reactions and bimolecular reactions with atmospheric constituents such as NO, NO2, NO3, O3, halogen oxides, HO2, and other RO2 species - are discussed. For each of these reaction pathways, basic reaction rates are presented, along with trends in reactivity with radical structure. Focus is placed on recent advances in detection methods and on recent advances in our understanding of radical cycling processes, particularly pertaining to the complex chemistry associated with the atmospheric oxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons."

The protocol aims to limit the number of reactions in a degradation scheme by applying a degree of strategic simplification, whilst maintaining the essential features of the chemistry.

    abstract = "Abstract Isoprene is emitted in large quantities by vegetation, exhaled by human beings and released in small quantities by road traffic. As a result of its high reactivity, isoprene is an important ozone precursor in the troposphere and can play a key role in atmospheric chemistry. Measurements of isoprene in urban areas in Central Europe are scarce. Thus, in Essen, Germany, the isoprene concentration was measured at various sites during different seasons using two compact online GC-PID systems. Isoprene concentrations were compared with those of benzene and toluene, which represent typical anthropogenic VOCs. In the summer, the diurnal variation in isoprene concentration was dependent on the biogenic emissions in the city. It was found that its maximum concentration occurred during the day, in contrast to the benzene and toluene concentrations. During the measurement period in the summer of 2012, the average hourly isoprene concentrations reached 0.13 to 0.17 ppb between 10 and 20 LST. At high air temperatures, the isoprene concentration exceeded the benzene and toluene concentrations at many of the sites. Isoprene became more important than toluene with regard to ozone formation in the city area during the afternoon hours of summer days with high air temperatures. This finding was demonstrated by the contributions to OH reactivity and ozone-forming potential. It contradicts the results of other studies, which were based on daily or seasonal average values. With an isoprene/benzene ratio of 0.02, the contribution of anthropogenic isoprene decreased substantially to a very low level during the last 20 years in Central Europe due to a strong reduction in road traffic emissions. In the vicinity of many people, isoprene concentrations of up to 0.54 ppb and isoprene/benzene ratios of up to 1.34 were found in the atmosphere due to isoprene exhaled by humans. "

    ABSTRACT = "We test the current generation of global chemistry–climate models in their ability to simulate observed, present-day surface ozone. Models are evaluated against hourly surface ozone from 4217 stations in North America and Europe that are averaged over 1° × 1° grid cells, allowing commensurate model–measurement comparison. Models are generally biased high during all hours of the day and in all regions. Most models simulate the shape of regional summertime diurnal and annual cycles well, correctly matching the timing of hourly (~ 15:00 local time (LT)) and monthly (mid-June) peak surface ozone abundance. The amplitude of these cycles is less successfully matched. The observed summertime diurnal range (~ 25 ppb) is underestimated in all regions by about 7 ppb, and the observed seasonal range (~ 21 ppb) is underestimated by about 5 ppb except in the most polluted regions, where it is overestimated by about 5 ppb. The models generally match the pattern of the observed summertime ozone enhancement, but they overestimate its magnitude in most regions. Most models capture the observed distribution of extreme episode sizes, correctly showing that about 80 \% of individual extreme events occur in large-scale, multi-day episodes of more than 100 grid cells. The models also match the observed linear relationship between episode size and a measure of episode intensity, which shows increases in ozone abundance by up to 6 ppb for larger-sized episodes. We conclude that the skill of the models evaluated here provides confidence in their projections of future surface ozone."

    abstract = {A chemical mass balance approach is used to determine the relative contributions of evaporative versus tailpipe sources to motor vehicle volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Contributions were determined by reconciling time-resolved ambient VOC concentrations measured downwind of Sacramento, California, in summer 2001 with source speciation profiles. A composite liquid fuel speciation profile was determined from gasoline samples collected at Sacramento area service stations. Vapor-liquid equilibrium relationships were used to determine the corresponding headspace vapor composition. VOC concentrations measured in a highway tunnel were used to define the composition of running vehicle emissions. The chemical mass balance analysis indicated that headspace vapor contributions ranged from 7 to 29\% of total vehicle-related VOC depending on time of day and day of week, with a mean daytime contribution of 17.0 ± 0.9\% (mean ± 95\% CI). A positive association between the headspace vapor contribution and ambient air temperature was found for afternoon hours. We estimate a 6.5 ± 2.5\% increase in vapor pressure-driven evaporative emissions and at least a 1.3 ± 0.4\% increase in daily total (exhaust plus evaporative) VOC emissions from motor vehicles per degree Celsius increase in maximum temperature.},

    abstract = "Calculation of the ozone production potential of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) has traditionally been performed using so-called incremental reactivity techniques, requiring multiple photochemical model runs in which the combined direct and indirect effects on ozone from slight perturbations to each VOC are investigated in turn. A new approach to this problem is presented here using an extensively tagged chemical mechanism, in which the direct effects of VOC on ozone are calculated using a single model run. The results of this approach are consistent with previous work, but deliver much more detailed information about the VOC intermediate oxidation products involved in the production of ozone. We show that different classes of VOC exhibit very different temporal evolution in their ozone production potential, with alkenes and reactive aromatic VOC producing ozone rapidly, while the ozone production potential of alkanes increases in the day after they are emitted. We suggest that this is related to the rate at which these different classes of compounds are able to produce very small oxidation fragments. This multi-day ozone production potential has implications for emission control strategies for the management of air quality in polluted regions. We also relate the ozone production potential of VOC to the OH reactivity of the VOC oxidation intermediates, and show that the early oxidation products of alkenes and reactive aromatics are more efficient at producing ozone in their subsequent reactions with OH than similarly reactive alkanes. While this study examines idealised chemical conditions in a box model, the techniques employed here could potentially be adapted to the study of a wider range of atmospheric conditions using three-dimensional air quality models.

	abstract = "Online coupled mesoscale meteorology atmospheric chemistry models have undergone a rapid evolution in recent years. Although mainly developed by the air quality modelling community, these models are also of interest for numerical weather prediction and regional climate modelling as they can consider not only the effects of meteorology on air quality, but also the potentially important effects of atmospheric composition on weather. Two ways of online coupling can be distinguished: online integrated and online access coupling. Online integrated models simulate meteorology and chemistry over the same grid in one model using one main time step for integration. Online access models use independent meteorology and chemistry modules that might even have different grids, but exchange meteorology and chemistry data on a regular and frequent basis. This article offers a comprehensive review of the current research status of online coupled meteorology and atmospheric chemistry modelling within Europe. Eighteen regional online coupled models developed or being used in Europe are described and compared. Topics discussed include a survey of processes relevant to the interactions between atmospheric physics, dynamics and composition; a brief overview of existing online mesoscale models and European model developments; an analysis on how feedback processes are treated in these models; numerical issues associated with coupled models; and several case studies and model performance evaluation methods. Finally, this article highlights selected scientific issues and emerging challenges that require proper consideration to improve the reliability and usability of these models for the three scientific communities: air quality, numerical meteorology modelling (including weather prediction) and climate modelling. This review will be of particular interest to model developers and users in all three fields as it presents a synthesis of scientific progress and provides recommendations for future research directions and priorities in the development, application and evaluation of online coupled models.",
