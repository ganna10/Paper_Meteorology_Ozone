Formed in the atmospheric oxidation of essentially every organic species emitted, their chemistry is part of the radical cycles that control the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and lead to the formation of ozone, organic nitrates, organic acids, particulate matter and other so-called secondary pollutants. In this review, laboratory studies of this peroxy radical chemistry are detailed, as they pertain to the chemistry of the atmosphere. First, a brief discussion of methods used to detect the peroxy radicals in the laboratory is presented. Then, the basic reaction pathways - involving RO2 unimolecular reactions and bimolecular reactions with atmospheric constituents such as NO, NO2, NO3, O3, halogen oxides, HO2, and other RO2 species - are discussed. For each of these reaction pathways, basic reaction rates are presented, along with trends in reactivity with radical structure. Focus is placed on recent advances in detection methods and on recent advances in our understanding of radical cycling processes, particularly pertaining to the complex chemistry associated with the atmospheric oxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons."

  abstract={The present work assesses the relationship between local and synoptic meteorological conditions and surface ozone concentration over Europe in spring and summer months, during the period 1998â€“2012 using a new interpolated data set of observed surface ozone concentrations over the European domain. Along with local meteorological conditions, the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation on surface ozone is addressed through a set of airflow indices computed with a novel implementation of a grid-by-grid weather type classification across Europe. Drivers of surface ozone over the full distribution of maximum daily 8 h average values are investigated, along with drivers of the extreme high percentiles and exceedances or air quality guideline thresholds. Three different regression techniques are applied: multiple linear regression to assess the drivers of maximum daily ozone, logistic regression to assess the probability of threshold exceedances and quantile regression to estimate the meteorological influence on extreme values, as represented by the 95th percentile. The relative importance of the input parameters (predictors) is assessed by a backward stepwise regression procedure that allows the identification of the most important predictors in each model. Spatial patterns of model performance exhibit distinct variations between regions. The inclusion of the ozone persistence is particularly relevant over southern Europe. In general, the best model performance is found over central Europe, where the maximum temperature plays an important role as a driver of maximum daily ozone as well as its extreme values, especially during warmer months.}

    abstract = {The O3-NOy relation for a polluted planetary boundary layer is investigated using numerical simulations and observations. Box model runs are carried out to study the sensitivity of the transition value of NOy, which separates the low-NOx. and the high-NOx regimes, to changes in emissions and in ambient conditions. It is shown that the transition value of NOy depends on the hydrocarbon and NOx emissions, on water vapor, on radiation, and on temperature. Increasing hydrocarbon emissions, increasing water vapor, increasing radiation, or increasing temperature shifts the transition value to higher levels. One-dimensional simulations, which include vertical mixing and dry deposition, show that increasing dry deposition reduces the transition value of NOy. Sensitivity studies with a three-dimensional nonhydrostatic model system are carried out to investigate the effects of transport. A smoothing procedure is applied to reduce the large scatter of the O3-NOy relation which is found in these cases. After smoothing, a transition value can be identified. For the southwestern part of Germany it is shown that this transition value indicates areas where NOx reduction leads to the most effective ozone reduction. Runs with various scenarios show the dependence of the transition value on emissions and ambient conditions. A normalization procedure is introduced. The normalization procedure is applied to the model results and to observations. Under high-NOx conditions a large difference between the cases with and without advection is found. It shows that in the three-dimensional case the ozone concentration is less sensitive to changes in the NOx emissions than in the case of pure chemistry.},

    abstract = {Tropospheric O3 concentrations are functions of the chain lengths of NOx (NOx â‰¡ NO + NO2) and HOx (HOx â‰¡ OH + HO2 + RO2) radical catalytic cycles. For a fixed HOx source at low NOx concentrations, kinetic models indicate the rate of O3 production increases linearly with increases in NOx concentrations (NOx limited). At higher NOx concentrations, kinetic models predict ozone production rates decrease with increasing NOx (NOx saturated). We present observations of NO, NO2, O3, OH, HO2, H2CO, actinic flux, and temperature obtained during the 1999 Southern Oxidant Study from June 15 to July 15, 1999, at Cornelia Fort Airpark, Nashville, Tennessee. The observations are used to evaluate the instantaneous ozone production rate (PO3) as a function of NO abundances and the primary HOx production rate (PHOx). These observations provide quantitative evidence for the response of PO3 to NOx. For high PHOx (0.5 < PHOx < 0.7 ppt/s), O3 production at this site increases linearly with NO to âˆ¼500 ppt. PO3 levels out in the range 500â€“1000 ppt NO and decreases for NO above 1000 ppt. An analysis along chemical coordinates indicates that models of chemistry controlling peroxy radical abundances, and consequently PO3, have a large error in the rate or product yield of the RO2 + HO2 reaction for the classes of RO2 that predominate in Nashville. Photochemical models and our measurements can be forced into agreement if the product of the branching ratio and rate constant for organic peroxide formation, via RO2 + HO2 â†’ ROOH + O2, is reduced by a factor of 3â€“12. Alternatively, these peroxides could be rapidly photolyzed under atmospheric conditions making them at best a temporary HOx reservoir. This result implies that O3 production in or near urban areas with similar hydrocarbon reactivity and HOx production rates may be NOx saturated more often than current models suggest.},
