Formed in the atmospheric oxidation of essentially every organic species emitted, their chemistry is part of the radical cycles that control the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and lead to the formation of ozone, organic nitrates, organic acids, particulate matter and other so-called secondary pollutants. In this review, laboratory studies of this peroxy radical chemistry are detailed, as they pertain to the chemistry of the atmosphere. First, a brief discussion of methods used to detect the peroxy radicals in the laboratory is presented. Then, the basic reaction pathways - involving RO2 unimolecular reactions and bimolecular reactions with atmospheric constituents such as NO, NO2, NO3, O3, halogen oxides, HO2, and other RO2 species - are discussed. For each of these reaction pathways, basic reaction rates are presented, along with trends in reactivity with radical structure. Focus is placed on recent advances in detection methods and on recent advances in our understanding of radical cycling processes, particularly pertaining to the complex chemistry associated with the atmospheric oxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons."

  abstract={The present work assesses the relationship between local and synoptic meteorological conditions and surface ozone concentration over Europe in spring and summer months, during the period 1998–2012 using a new interpolated data set of observed surface ozone concentrations over the European domain. Along with local meteorological conditions, the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation on surface ozone is addressed through a set of airflow indices computed with a novel implementation of a grid-by-grid weather type classification across Europe. Drivers of surface ozone over the full distribution of maximum daily 8 h average values are investigated, along with drivers of the extreme high percentiles and exceedances or air quality guideline thresholds. Three different regression techniques are applied: multiple linear regression to assess the drivers of maximum daily ozone, logistic regression to assess the probability of threshold exceedances and quantile regression to estimate the meteorological influence on extreme values, as represented by the 95th percentile. The relative importance of the input parameters (predictors) is assessed by a backward stepwise regression procedure that allows the identification of the most important predictors in each model. Spatial patterns of model performance exhibit distinct variations between regions. The inclusion of the ozone persistence is particularly relevant over southern Europe. In general, the best model performance is found over central Europe, where the maximum temperature plays an important role as a driver of maximum daily ozone as well as its extreme values, especially during warmer months.}

	abstract = {Modern climate change is dominated by human influences, which are now large enough to exceed the bounds of natural variability. The main source of global climate change is human-induced changes in atmospheric composition. These perturbations primarily result from emissions associated with energy use, but on local and regional scales, urbanization and land use changes are also important. Although there has been progress in monitoring and understanding climate change, there remain many scientific, technical, and institutional impediments to precisely planning for, adapting to, and mitigating the effects of climate change. There is still considerable uncertainty about the rates of change that can be expected, but it is clear that these changes will be increasingly manifested in important and tangible ways, such as changes in extremes of temperature and precipitation, decreases in seasonal and perennial snow and ice extent, and sea level rise. Anthropogenic climate change is now likely to continue for many centuries. We are venturing into the unknown with climate, and its associated impacts could be quite disruptive.},

Owing to its versatility and modular structure, it can be used for tropospheric as well as stratospheric chemistry calculations. Extending the code to other domains (e.g. mesospheric or oceanic chemistry) is easily possible. MECCA contains a comprehensive atmospheric reaction mechanism that currently includes: 1) the basic O3, CH4, HOx, and NOx chemistry, 2) non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) chemistry, 3) halogen (Cl, Br, I) chemistry, and 4) sulfur chemistry. Not only gas-phase chemistry but also aqueous-phase and heterogeneous reactions are considered. Arbitrary subsets of the comprehensive mechanism can be selected according to the research objectives. The program code resulting from the chemical mechanism can easily be used in any model, from a simple box model to a comprehensive global general circulation model.",

    abstract = "In this study, sophisticated sensitivity analyses of a detailed ozone dry deposition model were performed for five soil types (sand, sandy loam, loam, clay loam, clay) and four land use categories (agricultural land, grass, coniferous and deciduous forests). Deposition velocity and ozone flux depend on the weather situation, physiological state of the plants and numerous surface-, vegetation-, and soil-dependent parameters. The input data and the parameters of deposition-related calculations all have higher or lower spatial and temporal variability. We have investigated the effect of the variability of the meteorological data (cloudiness, relative humidity and air temperature), plant-dependent (leaf area index and maximum stomatal conductance) and soil-dependent (soil moisture) parameters on ozone deposition velocity. To evaluate this effect, two global methods, the Morris method and the Monte Carlo analysis with Latin hypercube sampling were applied. Additionally, local sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate the contribution of non-stomatal resistances to deposition velocity. Using the Monte Carlo simulations, the ensemble effect of several nonlinear processes can be recognised and described. Based on the results of the Morris method, the individual effects on deposition velocity are found to be significant in the case of soil moisture and maximum stomatal conductance. Temperature and leaf area index are also important factors; the former is primarily in the case of agricultural land, while the latter is for grass and coniferous forest. The results of local sensitivity analyses reveal the importance of non-stomatal resistances. "
