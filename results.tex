Figure~\ref{f:ozone_contours} depicts the maximum mixing ratio of ozone obtained from each model run as a function of the total \ce{NO_x} emissions on the first day and temperature.
Using each mechanism, a similar non-linear relationship of ozone mixing ratios on \ce{NO_x} and temperature is found and increased ozone levels are found at higher temperatures when including a temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions.
CB05 and RADM2 produce the largest amount of ozone at higher temperatures than the other chemical mechanisms.
A temperature-dependent source of isoprene, leads to more efficient ozone production \todo{how? prove this} as at higher temperature a lower amount of \ce{NO_x} is required to produce the same amount of ozone as when using a temperature-independent source of isoprene.
At low temperature and high \ce{NO_x}, similar amounts of ozone are predicted from both the temperature-dependent and temperature-independent sources of isoprene emissions.

\subsection{Rate of Change of Ozone with Temperature}

Three \ce{NO_x} regimes--Low-NOx, High-NOx and Maximal-O3-- are determined using the ratio of \ce{H2O2} to \ce{HNO3}, this ratio has been shown in \citet{Sillman:1995} to describe the different regimes of ozone production in relation to \ce{NO_x} and VOC levels.
Values of \ce{H2O2}/\ce{HNO3} less than $0.3$ correspond to the High-NOx regime, values larger than $0.5$ correspond to the Low-NOx regime and all values inbetween correspond to the ridge area in which maximal ozone is produced.
Each model run was allocated to one of the three regimes for each temperature and the mean ozone mixing ratio in these \ce{NO_x} regimes were then correlated with temperature as shown in Fig.~\ref{f:rate_O3_T}.
In literature, a linear relationship is typically reported between ozone and temperature and so the linear regression statistics are reported in Table~\ref{t:O3_T_stats}.

The linear increase of ozone with temperature, m$_{\text{O3-T}}$ in Table~\ref{t:O3_T_stats}, is highest at high-NOx conditions for each chemical mechanism and for each temperature case of isoprene emissions.
The high-NOx regime corresponds to the top regions of the contour plots in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_contours} where increases in temperature would shift the ozone production towards the ridge of maximal ozone production, thus this increase in m$_{\text{O3-T}}$ is expected.
Similarly, the lowest m$_{\text{O3-T}}$ are achieved in the low-NOx regime, the bottom regions of the contours in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_contours}, where increases in temperature do not neccisarily lead to increased ozone levels.
