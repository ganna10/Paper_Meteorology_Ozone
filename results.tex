Figure~\ref{f:ozone_contours} depicts the maximum mixing ratio of ozone obtained from each model run as a function of the total \ce{NO_x} emissions on the first day and temperature.
Using each mechanism, a similar non-linear relationship of ozone mixing ratios on \ce{NO_x} and temperature is found and increased ozone levels are found at higher temperatures when including a temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions.
CB05 and RADM2 produce the largest amount of ozone at higher temperatures and higher \ce{NO_x} levels than the other chemical mechanisms.

The temperature-dependent source of isoprene leads to increased ozone mixing ratios at higher temperatures and higher \ce{NO_x} levels (top-right of each plot in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_contours}).
The largest increase in ozone is found in the MCMv3.2 and CRIv2, where the ozone increased by 16~ppbv when using temperature-dependent isoprene emissions.
All other mechanisms, had similar increases in ozone with temperature-dependent isoprene emissions; RADM2 with an increase of 11~ppbv had the lowest increase in ozone.
At low temperatures, regardless of the \ce{NO_x} level, similar amounts of ozone are predicted from both the temperature-dependent and temperature-independent sources of isoprene emissions.

We defined the \ce{O_x} family to consist of \todo{complete this and reasons}

\citet{Sillman:1995} shows that the ratio of \ce{HNO3} to \ce{H2O2} can be used to determine whether an atmospheric system is in a \ce{NO_x}-sensitive, VOC-sensitive or in the ridge region of the \ce{NO_x}-VOC relationship with ozone, where maximum ozone is produced.
Based on this, we assigned each model run used to generate the ozone contours in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_contours} to three \ce{NO_x} regimes--Low-NOx, High-NOx and Maximal-O3--corresponding to \ce{NO_x}-sensitive, VOC-sensitive and \ce{NO_x}-VOC-sensitive regions defined by \citet{Sillman:1995}.
Values of \ce{H2O2}/\ce{HNO3} less than $0.3$ correspond to the High-NOx regime, values larger than $0.5$ correspond to the Low-NOx regime and all values inbetween correspond to the ridge area in which maximal ozone is produced.

In Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_budgets}, the production rates on the first day of each reaction contributing to the \ce{O_x} production budget are determined and these reaction rates are then averaged over each \ce{NO_x}-condition (Low-\ce{NO_x}, High-\ce{NO_x} and Maximal-O3).
The fractional contribution of this reaction rate to the total \ce{O_x} budget was then calculated for each \ce{NO_x}-condition.

Figure~\ref{f:ozone_budgets} shows that the reaction of the hydroperoxyl radical (\ce{HO2}) with NO has the largest contribution at each \ce{NO_x}-condition, but this fractional contribution decreaes at higher temperatures due to the increased contributions of other reactions.
The increased contribution of the reaction of the acetyl peroxy radical (\ce{CH3CO3}) with NO with temperature has the most significant contribution to the total \ce{O_x} budget and this contribution is higher in CB05 and RADM2 compared to the other chemical mechanisms.

\subsection{Rate of Change of Ozone with Temperature} \label{ss:r_mO3-T}

\begin{figure}%
    \centering%
    \caption{Correlation of mean ozone mixing ratio with temperature in Low-NOx, maximal-O3 and High-NOx conditions for each chemical mechanism. A linear relationship between mean ozone mixing ratios and temperature is inferred, regression statistics are found in Table~\ref{t:O3_T_stats}.}%

    %\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Mean_O3_T_NOx_conditions}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}%
    \centering%
    \caption{Regression statistics for the linear relationship between ozone mixing ratios and temperature shown in Figure~\ref{f:rate_O3_T}.}%
    \label{t:O3_T_stats}%
    \input{table_regression_O3_T_stats}
\end{table}

Each model run was allocated the three \ce{NO_x}-conditions as described in Sect.~\ref{ss:r_budgets} and then the mean ozone mixing ratio in these \ce{NO_x} regimes were then correlated with temperature as shown in Fig.~\ref{f:rate_O3_T}.
In literature, a linear relationship is typically reported between ozone and temperature and so the linear regression statistics are reported in Table~\ref{t:O3_T_stats}.

The linear increase of ozone with temperature, m$_{\text{O3-T}}$ in Table~\ref{t:O3_T_stats}, is highest at high-NOx conditions for each chemical mechanism and for each temperature case of isoprene emissions.
The high-NOx regime corresponds to the top regions of the contour plots in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_contours} where increases in temperature would shift the ozone production towards the ridge of maximal ozone production, thus this increase in m$_{\text{O3-T}}$ is expected.
Similarly, the lowest m$_{\text{O3-T}}$ are achieved in the low-NOx regime, the bottom regions of the contours in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_contours}, where increases in temperature do not neccisarily lead to increased ozone levels.
