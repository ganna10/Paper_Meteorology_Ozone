Figure~\ref{f:ozone_contours} depicts the maximum mixing ratio of ozone obtained from each model run as a function of the total \ce{NO_x} emissions on the first day and temperature.
Using each mechanism, a similar non-linear relationship of ozone mixing ratios on \ce{NO_x} and temperature is found and increased ozone levels are found at higher temperatures when including a temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions.
CB05 and RADM2 produce the largest amount of ozone at higher temperatures than the other chemical mechanisms.
A temperature-dependent source of isoprene, leads to more efficient ozone production \todo{how? prove this} as at higher temperature a lower amount of \ce{NO_x} is required to produce the same amount of ozone as when using a temperature-independent source of isoprene.
At low temperature and high \ce{NO_x}, similar amounts of ozone are predicted from both the temperature-dependent and temperature-independent sources of isoprene emissions.
