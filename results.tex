Figure~\ref{f:ozone_contours} depicts the maximum mixing ratio of ozone as a function of the total \ce{NO_x} emissions on the first day of simulations and temperature when using temperature-independent and temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions for each chemical mechanism.
A non-linear relationship of ozone mixing ratios with \ce{NO_x} and temperature is reproduced by each chemical mechanism.
This non-linear relationship has a similar form to that determined by \citet{Pusede:2014} using an analytical model constrained to observational measurements over the San Joaquin Valley in California.

Larger ozone mixing ratios are produced when using a temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions in the ridges of the ozone contours and for higher emissions of \ce{NO_x} in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_contours}.
The highest mixing ratios of ozone in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_contours} are produced at higher temperatures and high emissions of \ce{NO_x} regardless of the source of isoprene emissions.
Conversely, the least amount of ozone is produced with low emissions of \ce{NO_x} over the whole temperature range ($15$~--~$40$~\degree C) when using both a temperature-independent and temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions.

The contours of ozone mixing ratios as a function of \ce{NO_x} and temperature can be split into three \ce{NO_x}-regimes (Low-\ce{NO_x}, Maximal-\ce{O3} and High-\ce{NO_x}).
The Low-\ce{NO_x} regime corresponds to the regions where there is little increase in ozone with temperature, also called \ce{NO_x}-sensitive regime.
The High-\ce{NO_x} (or \ce{NO_x}-saturated) regime is when ozone levels increase rapidly with temperature and the ridges of the contours in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_contours} correspond to regions of maximal ozone production and we call this the Maximal-\ce{O3} regime.
\citet{Pusede:2014} have shown that temperature can be used as a proxy for VOC, thus we used the ratio of \ce{HNO3} to \ce{H2O2} used by \citet{Sillman:1995} to determine \ce{NO_x}-regimes for the non-linear relationship of ozone with \ce{NO_x} and VOC to assign the ozone mixing ratios for each simulation to the defined \ce{NO_x} regimes..
Fig.~\ref{f:O3-T} illustrates the mean ozone mixing ratio at each temperature in the three \ce{NO_x} regimes for each chemical mechanism and each source of isoprene emissions.

The absolute increase in ozone at $40$~\degree C from $20$~\degree C due to faster chemistry is the difference in ozone mixing ratios at $40$~\degree C and $20$~\degree C when using a temperature-independent source of isoprene emissions.
When using a temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions, the difference in ozone mixing ratios at $40$~\degree C from $20$~\degree C minus the increase due to faster chemistry, gives the absolute increase in ozone due to increased isoprene emissions.
These differences are represented graphically in Fig.~\ref{f:O3-T} and summarised in Table~\ref{t:differences}.

Both Fig.~\ref{f:O3-T} and Table~\ref{t:differences} highlight that the absolute increase in ozone at $40$~\degree C from $20$~\degree C is largest with High-\ce{NO_x} conditions.
The increase in ozone mixing ratio at $40$~\degree C from $20$~\degree C due to faster chemistry with high-\ce{NO_x} conditions is almost double that with Low-\ce{NO_x} conditions.
We shall explore which chemical processes are responsible for the increases in ozone mixing ratios at $40$~\degree C from $20$~\degree C by analysing \ce{O_x} production budgets in Sect.~\ref{ss:r_budgets}.

Comparing the response of ozone mixing ratios to temperature in the reduced chemical mechanisms (CRIv2, MOZART-4, CB05 and RADM2) to the near-explicit MCMv3.2 chemical mechanism shows that the largest differences from the MCMv3.2 occur in the Maximal-\ce{O3} and High-\ce{NO_x} regimes.
Table~\ref{t:differences} also indicates that all reduced chemical mechanisms, except RADM2, have similar increases in ozone due to increased isoprene emissions to MCMv3.2.
RADM2 produces $3$~ppbv less ozone than the MCMv3.2 due to increased isoprene emissions consistently in each \ce{NO_x} regime, indicating that this difference is due to how isoprene degradation chemistry is treated in RADM2.

The Tagged Ozone Production Potential (TOPP) is a measure of the number of molecules of ozone produced per molecule of VOC emitted originally defined in \citet{Butler:2011} and used to compare different chemical mechanisms to the near-explicit {MCMv3.2} in \citet{Coates:2015}.
\citet{Coates:2015} showed that less ozone is produced per molecule of isoprene emitted using RADM2 than with MCMv3.2.
The degradation of isoprene has been extensively studied and it is well-known that the secondary degradtion species methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein are signatures of isoprene degradation.
All chemical mechanisms except RADM2 used in our study explicitly represent MVK and methacrolein (in the case of CB05, a lumped species representing both these secondary degradation products) production during isoprene degradation.
RADM2 does not represent methacrolein and the mechanism species representing ketones represents a mixture of acetone and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). 
Thus the secondary degradation of isoprene in RADM2 is unable to represent the ozone production from the further degradation of the signature secondary degradation products of isoprene, MVK and methacrolein.
Updated versions of RADM2, RACM \citep{Stockwell:1997} and RACM2 \citep{Goliff:2013}, sequentially include methacrolein and MVK and with these updates the TOPP values of isoprene approach the TOPP value of isoprene in the MCMv3.2 \citep{Coates:2015}.

\subsection{Ozone Production Budgets} \label{ss:r_budgets}

\begin{figure}[t]%
    \centering%
    \caption{Day-time \ce{O_x} production budgets normalised by the total oxidation rate of emitted VOC in the \ce{NO_x}-regimes of Fig.~\ref{f:O3-T}. The budgets are allocated to categories of inorganic reactions, peroxy nitrate (RO2NO2) decomposition, reactions of NO with HO2, alkyl peroxy radicals (RO2) and acyl peroxy radicals (ARO2). All other reactions contributing to \ce{O_x} budgets are allocated to the `Other Organic' category.}%
    \label{f:ozone_budgets}%
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Ox_budgets}
\end{figure}

The total day-time production budgets of \ce{O_x} ($\equiv$ \ce{O3 + NO2 + O}) normalised by the total rate of oxidation of the emitted VOC are displayed in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_budgets}.
The \ce{O_x} production budgets are assigned to each \ce{NO_x} regime for each chemical mechanism and source of isoprene emissions.
The budgets allocated to the major sources, where `HO2', `RO2', `ARO2' represent the reactions of NO with \ce{HO2}, alkyl peroxy radicals and acyl peroxy radicals respectively.
`RO2NO2' represents the thermal decomposition of peroxy nitrates, `Inorganic' represents all inorganic contributions to \ce{O_x} production (primarily the de-excitation of \ce{O^1D} to O) and any other remaining organic reactions producing \ce{O_x} are included in the `Other Organic' category.

In Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_budgets} the number of molecules of \ce{O_x} produced per molecule of emitted VOC oxidised in High-\ce{NO_x} conditions is similar when using either a temperature-dependent or a temperature-independent isoprene emissions for each chemical mechanism, the same is true for the Maximal-\ce{O3} and Low-\ce{NO_x} regimes.
Thus the increases in isoprene emissions with temperature are balanced by the faster oxidation rates of the increased amounts of emitted isoprene.
The highest amount of \ce{O_x} is produced in the High-\ce{NO_x} regime and the lowest amount of \ce{O_x} is produced in the Low-\ce{NO_x} regime, mirroring the \ce{O3} mixing ratios in the different \ce{NO_x} regimes in Fig.\ref{f:O3-T}.
For example, MCMv3.2 produces seven molecules of \ce{O_x} per molecule of emitted VOC oxidised in High-\ce{NO_x} conditions decreasing to about six and five molecules of \ce{O_x} per molecule of emitted VOC oxidised in the Maximal-\ce{O3} and Low-\ce{NO_x} regimes.

In each \ce{NO_x} regime, each reduced chemical mechanism produces up to two molecules of \ce{O_x} per molecule of emitted VOC oxidised less than the MCMv3.2 despite the reduced chemical mechanisms producing similar absolute amounts of ozone to the MCMv3.2 (Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_contours} and Fig.~\ref{f:O3-T}).
This is similar the results of \citet{Coates:2015} where many reduced mechanisms produced similar absolute amounts of ozone but the amount of ozone produced per emitted VOC in the reduced chemical mechanisms was lower than that of the MCMv3.2.
A faster breakdown of the emitted VOC in reduced chemical mechanisms compared to the MCMv3.2 led to lower amounts of ozone produced per emitted VOC in the reduced chemical mechanisms.

Peroxy nitrate (RO2NO2) decomposition has the largest contribution to the normalised \ce{O_x} production at higher temperatures in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_budgets} and will be analysed further in Sect.~\ref{sss:ro2no2}.
While the contribution of RO2NO2 decomposition to normalised \ce{O_x} production increases with temperature, the contribution of inorganic reactions to normalised \ce{O_x} production decreases with temperature in all \ce{NO_x} regimes, each chemical mechanism and regardless of the source of isoprene emissions.
Whereas the contributions of the reaction of NO with the peroxy radicals (HO2, RO2 and ARO2 in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_budgets}) to the normalised production of \ce{O_x} do not increase strongly with temperature indicating that these processes are strongly related to the faster degradation of the emitted VOC with temperature.

\subsubsection{Peroxy Nitrates} \label{sss:ro2no2}
We shall now turn our focus to the peroxy nitrate (\ce{RO2NO2}) contribution to the normalised \ce{O_x} production as this category has a strongly temperature-dependent contribution in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_budgets}.
Peroxy nitrates are formed from the reactions of alkyl and acyl peroxy nitrates with \ce{NO2} (Reaction \ref{r:RO2_NO2}) and are an important reservoir species for both peroxy radicals and \ce{NO_x}.
\begin{rxnarray}
    && \ce{RO2 + NO2 + M} \rightleftharpoons \ce{RO2NO2 + M} \label{r:RO2_NO2}
\end{rxnarray}
The chemical bond of \ce{RO2NO2} is quite weak with thermal decomposition being the most important chemical process and the rate of thermal decomposition increases strongly with temperature.
At low temperatures, \ce{RO2NO2} can accumulate and be transported downwind of emissions of the sources of its precursors (VOC and \ce{NO_x}). 
After thermal decomposition of \ce{RO2NO2}, the release of \ce{NO2} and peroxy radicals can promote production of \ce{O3} downwind \citep{Moxim:1996}.

Peroxy nitrates are formed from both alkyl and acyl peroxy radicals produced during the secondary degradation of emitted VOC.
The most important alkyl peroxy nitrates are pernitric acid (\ce{HO2NO2}) and methylperoxy nitrate (\ce{CH3O2NO2}), while peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN, \ce{CH3C(O)O2NO2}) and peroxy propionyl nitrate (PPN, \ce{C2H5C(O)O2NO2}) are important acyl peroxy nitrates.
The alkyl peroxy nitrates have a weaker \ce{RO2-NO2} bond than acyl peroxy nitrates hence alkyl peroxy nitrates have a shorter lifetime than acyl peroxy nitrates.
For example, \ce{CH3O2NO2} has a lifetime of $0.5$~seconds at $298$~K while PAN has a lifetime of $51$~minutes at $298$~K \citep{Orlando:2012}.

Each chemical mechanism used in our study represents \ce{HO2NO2} and PAN, although in many reduced chemical mechanisms the PAN mechanism species represents \ce{CH3C(O)O2NO2} and other acyl peroxy nitrates.
This representation of PAN in reduced chemical mechanisms can overestimate PAN levels compared to more detailed chemical mechanisms \citep{Luecken:1999}.
The near-explicit MCMv3.2 represent a diverse range of peroxy nitrates including \ce{CH3O2NO2} and about $280$~acyl peroxy nitrates.

    \caption{Day-time \ce{RO2NO2} production budgets normalised by the total oxidation rate of emitted VOC in the \ce{NO_x}-regimes of Fig.~\ref{f:O3-T}. The total budgets are allocated to the most important peroxy nitrates and all other contributions included as `Others'.}%
    \label{f:ro2no2_budgets}%
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/RO2NO2_budgets}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{f:ro2no2_budgets} displays the normalised production budgets of \ce{RO2NO2} by the total oxidation rate of the emitted NMVOC, similar to Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_budgets}, for each chemical mechanism in each \ce{NO_x} regime and when using a temperature-independent and temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions.
The large contribution of \ce{CH3O2NO2} to normalised \ce{RO2NO2} production in MCMv3.2 is missing from the budgets of each reduced chemical mechanism as \ce{CH3O2NO2} is not represented in any of the reduced chemical mechanisms.
In fact the number of molecules of \ce{RO2NO2} produced per molecule of emitted VOC oxidised in each reduced chemical mechanism is similar to that of MCMv3.2 without the contribution of \ce{CH3O2NO2} for the separate \ce{NO_x} regimes and regardless of isoprene source.

The contribution of \ce{RO2NO2} to the normalised \ce{O_x} production in Fig.~\ref{f:ozone_budgets} is largest in the MCMv3.2 than the reduced chemical mechanisms due to the representation of \ce{CH3O2NO2} in the MCMv3.2.
If reduced chemical mechanisms represent \ce{CH3O2NO2} chemistry then this would improve the representation of the total \ce{RO2NO2} production which would have the added effect of improving the representation of \ce{O_x} production budgets.

This section compares the results from the idealised box model simulations to real-world observations and model output from a 3-D model verifying the applicability of our results to more realistic atmopsheric conditions.
\citet{Otero:2016} used the interpolated observational data set of the ERA-Interim re-analysis data set of \citet{Schnell:2015} which includes the daily maximum temperature and daily maximum 8~h mean of ozone for the years 1998--2012 over Europe.
In their study, \citet{Otero:2016} showed that over the summer (JJA) months, temperature is the main meteorological driver of ozone production over many regions of central Europe.
\colorbox{red}{Katie} provided model output from the 3-D WRF-Chem regional model set-up over the European domain for simulations of the year 2007 using MOZART-4 and RADM2 chemistry \todo{Katie ref.}.

Figure~\ref{f:comparison} compares the summer data of 2007 from observations (ERA-Interim), WRF-Chem simulations and the maximum 8~h mean ozone from the box model simulations using a temperature-independent and temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions for each chemical mechanism and allocated to the different \ce{NO_x}-regimes.
In Fig.~\ref{f:comparison}, only days where the daily maximum temperature corresponded to the temperature range in our study ($15$--$40$~\degree C) were considered from the ERA-Interim observational data set.
We selected two regions of the gridded domains of the observations and WRF-Chem output to central and eastern Germany (Fig.~\ref{f:WRF_ERA_Germany}) and central and western Poland (Fig.~\ref{f:WRF_ERA_Poland}) as the summertime ozone values in these regions are correlated with temperature \citep{Otero:2016}.
Table~\ref{t:mo3-t} summarises the slopes (m$_{\text{O3-T}}$) of the linear fits of all the ozone-temperature correlations displayed in Fig.~\ref{f:comparison} in ppbv of ozone per \degree C.

The spread of the ERA-Interim ozone-temperature values over both Germany and Poland are generally captured by the combined WRF-Chem simulations using both MOZART-4 and RADM2 chemistry. 
However, the ozone-temperature outputs from WRF-Chem using MOZART-4 chemistry only reproduces the higher ozone values with temperature from ERA-Interim but not the lower values.
On the other hand, WRF-Chem with RADM2 only reproduces the lower ozone values from the ERA-Interim data.
The slope of the linear ozone-temperature correlation from the WRF-Chem simulations using MOZART-4 is closer to the ERA-Interim data than the WRF-Chem simulations using RADM2.
However, the ozone values at the lower end of the temperature range ($15$--$18$~\degree C) are not reproduced with WRF-Chem using either MOZART-4 or RADM2 chemistry.

The box model simulations using a temperature-independent source of isoprene emissions do not reproduce the spread of ozone-temperature values of ERA-Interim, also indicated by the m$_{\text{O3-T}}$ values in Table~\ref{t:mo3-t}.
When using a temperature-dependent source of isoprene emissions in the box model, the ozone-temperature values from the ERA-Interim data over Germany and Poland are improved as seen by the m$_{\text{O3-T}}$ values in Table~\ref{t:mo3-t} but still lower than the observed slopes.
High-\ce{NO_x} conditions with a temperature-dependent source of isoprene produce the most similar ozone-temperature slope to the observational data.
However, this closest m$_{\text{O3-T}}$ from the box model simulations is still lower by a factor of two than the observed ozone-temperature slope.
In particular, the box model simulations over-predict the ozone values at lower temperatures and under-predict the ozone values at higher temperatures than the ERA-Interim data, regardless of the chemical mechanism.

One reason for the box model simulations being less sensitive to temperature than the observations are related to the set-up of the experiments compared to observations.
Observations consider the total effect of temperature on ozone, while models represent the individual effects of temperature on ozone separately. 
In other words, observational studies look at the total derivative of ozone with temperature while models look at the partial derivatives of the temperature-dependent processes influencing ozone. 
\begin{equation*} 
    \frac{d[\ce{O3}]}{dT} = \frac{\partial [\ce{O3}]}{\partial [\text{BVOC}]}\frac{\partial [\text{BVOC}]}{\partial T} + \frac{\partial [\ce{O3}]}{\partial \text{Chemistry}}\frac{\partial \text{Chemistry}}{\partial T} + \frac{\partial [\ce{O3}]}{\partial \text{Stagnation}}\frac{\partial \text{Stagnation}}{\partial T} + \dots
\end{equation*}

In our simulations, we focused on determining whether faster chemistry or increased BVOC emissions are more important for the increase of ozone with temperature from a freshly-emitted plume not under stagnant conditions.  
In stagnant atmospheric conditions, the ozone built-up from the previous day is not transported away from the region and can lead to increased ozone levels with the production of fresh ozone from new emissions.  
3-D models such as WRF-Chem would play a valuable role for further work also considering stagnant conditions as these models also include meteorological processes missing from our box model set-up.
Despite these short-comings of our box model set-up, the detailed analysis of the chemistry provided in this study should complement any future analysis of the ozone-temperature relationship.
