Surface ozone is a secondary air pollutant produced during the degradation of emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight and nitrogen oxides (\ce{NO_x}). 
Temperature directly influences ozone production through speeding up the rates of the chemical reactions producing ozone and increasing the emissions of VOCs, such as isoprene, from vegetation.
In this study, we used a box model to reproduce the non-linear relationship of ozone with \ce{NO_x} and temperature from previous observational studes.
An increase in ozone of up to $20$~ppbv was due to faster reaction rates while increased isoprene emissions added a further $11$~ppbv of ozone under high-\ce{NO_x} conditions.
The increased rate of VOC loss with temperature controlled the rate of \ce{O_x} production with temperature increasing net \ce{O_x} production by $\sim1$~molecule of \ce{O_x} per loss of VOC.
The rate of increase in ozone with temperature from our box model simulations was about half the rate of increase in ozone with temperature over central Europe compared to both observed values and WRF-Chem output.
The missing sensitivity in our simulations compared to observations and 3D model output is related to not including stagnant atmospheric conditions in our experiment.
